                  <h2>1. Consult: Cover letter</h2>

                  <p>
                     Respected Sir/Ma'am,
<br>
<br>
My name is Devansh Jain, a third-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Sciences in Mathematics and Computing at IIT Kharagpur. My interests lie in social impact consulting, strategy, and venture capital. I am writing to express my strong interest in the XYZ’s Internship Program and to convey my enthusiasm for contributing to your esteemed organization's mission of driving inclusive growth through strategic advisory services. 
<br>
<br>
My academic journey in Mathematics and Entrepreneurship has equipped me with a robust foundation in strategic thinking, analytical capabilities, and a keen understanding of private sector dynamics. 
<br>
<br>
I have actively sought opportunities to apply these skills in real-world settings, most notably during my internship as a Strategy Intern at <strong>Feeding India by Zomato</strong>, where I primarily worked on the food recovery project of the Global FoodBanking Network <i>impacting millions of farmers to reduce their farm loss by 10-15% and increasing their incomes substantially</i>. I have also led public-private partnerships addressing malnutrition and had the opportunity to work with the <strong>Offices of Hon'ble Governors and Hon'ble Chief Ministers</strong>, alongside multiple in-house innovation initiatives to revamp the food ecosystem in the nation further honing my strategic skills.
<br>
<br>
In addition, I have had the privilege of serving as the <strong>Asia head of the Junior IB</strong>, a student-led financial organization created with the motive to disrupt financial education and research. This role allowed me to deep dive into M&A deals, contributing significantly to my understanding of the financial landscape and enhancing my leadership and strategic skills.Furthermore, my role as the <strong>chief of staff at Getactvy</strong>, a fitness & healthtech startup featured in Forbes 100 to Watch, has been instrumental in shaping my vision for making a social impact. 
<br>
<br>
In the past, I have worked as a Research Associate at <strong>Cambridge Judge Business School</strong>, focusing on strengthening Micro, Small, and medium Enterprises, and as a Strategy and Marketing Intern at <strong>Blu Ocean Private Limited</strong>, managing their celebrity collaborations including Robert Downey Jr. I have also worked at the prestigious <strong>Scheller College of Business, Georgia Tech</strong> in the finance domain. 
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, my ability to collaborate across diverse sectors has been demonstrated through my involvement in the <strong>Entrepreneurship Cell at IIT Kharagpur</strong>. I facilitated the highest-ever funding(1.2 Cr+ INR) to startups and organized India’s largest Business Model competition, Empresario. Besides that, I have also excelled in numerous case study competitions such as the prestigious <strong>Tata Steel TomorrowLAB Innovation Challenge 3rd edition, Indian Case Challenge, EY Cafta Case Championship, HSBC Case Competition, and HackOn with Amazon 3.0</strong> where I worked seamlessly with stakeholders from public, private, and philanthropic sectors to achieve common goals.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to the impactful work.
<br>
<br>
Yours sincerely,
<br>
Devansh Jain

<br><br>
I love case studies; my team and I were among the <strong>Top teams of the Indian Case Challenge</strong> 2023, organized by the Business Club at IIT Kharagpur. We prepared an executive summary and investment analysis for TATA’s fab and recommended a $58.46 billion investment requirement for entry into the semiconductor industry.
